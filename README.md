Diabetes Prediction using PyCaret
This project shows how to use PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python, to predict diabetes occurrence in a population set.

Dataset:

The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains various diagnostic measurements and a binary outcome indicating whether a patient has diabetes.

Steps Performed:

Environment Setup: The PyCaret environment is initialized with the dataset and the necessary parameters.
Model Comparison: Multiple models are trained and compared to identify the best performing one.
Model Creation: The best model from the comparison is selected for further tuning.
Model Tuning: The model's hyperparameters are tuned for better performance.
Evaluation and Visualization: The model's performance is visualized using various metrics such as the confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, feature importance, and the distribution of predicted probabilities.

Installation:

Ensure you have the PyCaret library installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

'''
pip install pycaret
'''

Data Loading:
Load the Pima Indians Diabetes Database into a pandas DataFrame(df).

PyCaret Setup:
Set up the PyCaret environment with the dataset. This will preprocess the data and make it ready for modeling.

Model Training and Comparison:
Compare multiple models to select the best performing one. Train this model for further tuning and evaluation.

Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using various built-in visualizations provided by PyCaret.

Code:
You can follow the code provided in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook to walk through the entire process.
